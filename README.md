Tamarind
========

Tamaring is a very basic javascript carousel.

It's heavy work in progress at the moment.

## The idea

The Tamarind javascript carousel is the carousel that only provides the functionality of a javascript carousel.

The styling, markup and whatnot is totally up to you.

Because almost every carousel is packed with options and stylesheets, I decided to create Tamarind. The goal is to keep this as basic as possible, so customizing is no hassle.
